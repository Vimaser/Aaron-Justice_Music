# Arron-Justice-Music

Freelance project building a personal site for a musician using google firebase as a backend. Site will have contact, events, footer, gallery, and music all easily updated by the user via an admin portal. Project is built in react, using firebase. 

- FRI 9/22/2023
Project started, react helloWorld works, set up basic components and connected the firebase "backEnd" for the admin portal. Admin portal works, CRUD functions for events. Still need to impliment music and image uploads. Will set a cap on these so the user doesn't exceed bandwidth limits. Originally set up a protectedroute.js, but will remove because the admin route now requires login to be successful. No need for JWT since admin route is a single page. No styling, will put a very-very basic bootstrap next before custom styling. Will not be able to work on this until Monday.
